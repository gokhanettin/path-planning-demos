    "## Global and Local Planners\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics, we generally have two planners namely, Global and Local Planners. While global planners produce a rough path from start point to goal point, local planners run much more frequently to avoid local obstacles along the path produced by the global planners. These planners are utilized in many different kinds of robotics applications from autonomous cars to robotics arms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planner Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Planners can be categorized according to the way they work. While some planners produce plans searching through a a grid structure, others randomly sample the search space to reach at the goal. The former planners are called *grid search-based planners*. The latter ones are known as *sampling-based planners.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Because grid search-based planners requires a discritized grid cells, they tend to demand more computational power. Sampling-based planners on the other hand create a plan by selecting random points in the free configuration space without any discritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example grid search based planners are Breath First Search, Dijkstra, A*...\n",
    "\n",
    "Example sampling-based planners are RRT(Rapidly Exploring Random Tree), RRTStar, RRTConnect, PRM(Probabilistic Road Map)."
